# Ably Asset Tracking SDKs for Cocoa

Test force push!

![.github/workflows/check.yml](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa/workflows/.github/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

Ably Asset Tracking SDKs provide an easy way to track multiple assets with realtime location updates powered by [Ably](https://ably.com/) realtime network and Mapbox [Navigation SDK](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/overview/) with location enhancement.

**Status:** this is a beta version of the SDKs. That means that it contains a subset of the final SDK functionality, and the APIs are subject to change. The latest release of the SDKs is available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa/releases) of this repository.

Ably Asset Tracking is:

- **easy to integrate** - comprising two complementary SDKs with easy to use APIs, available for multiple platforms:
    - Asset Publishing SDK, for embedding in apps running on the courier's device
    - Asset Subscribing SDK, for embedding in apps runnong on the customer's observing device
- **extensible** - as Ably is used as the underlying transport, you have direct access to your data and can use Ably integrations for a wide range of applications in addition to direct realtime subscriptions - examples include:
    - passing to a 3rd party system
    - persistence for later retrieval
- **built for purpose** - the APIs and underlying functionality are designed specifically to meet the requirements of a range of common asset tracking use-cases

In this repository there are two SDKs for iOS devices:

- the [Asset Publishing SDK](Publisher/)
- the [Asset Subscribing SDK](Subscriber/)

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0+ / iPadOS 12.0+
- Xcode 12.4+
- Swift 5.3+
- Cocoapods: 1.10+

## Installation

### Cocoapods

- The SDK has not been released to Cocoapods.org, but you can use it by downloading it from the GitHub repository:
- To use the Asset Tracking Publisher or Subscriber SDKs, add the relevant following lines to your Podfile
  ```
  target 'Your App Name' do
    pod 'AblyAssetTracking/Publisher', :git => 'https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa' // To use the Publisher SDK
    pod 'AblyAssetTracking/Subscriber', :git => 'https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa' // To use the Subscriber SDK
  end
  ```
- `pod install`

### Swift package manager

Not currently supported, but [planned](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa/issues/148).

## Usage

The Asset Publishing SDK is used to get the location of the assets that need to be tracked.

Here is an example of how the Asset Publishing SDK can be used:

```swift
// Initialise a Publisher
publisher = try? PublisherFactory.publishers() // get a Publisher Builder
  .connection(ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY,
                                      clientId: CLIENT_ID)) // provide Ably configuration with credentials
  .log(LogConfiguration()) // provide logging configuration
  .transportationMode(TransportationMode()) // provide mode of transportation for better location enhancements
  .delegate(self) // provide delegate to handle location updates locally if needed
  .start()

// Start tracking an asset
publisher?.track(trackable: Trackable(id: trackingId)) // provide a tracking ID of the asset
```

Asset Subscribing SDK is used to receive the location of the required assets.

Here is an example of how Asset Subscribing SDK can be used:

```swift
subscriber = try? SubscriberFactory.subscribers() // get a Subscriber Builder
  .connection(ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY,
                                      clientId: CLIENT_ID)) // provide Ably configuration with credentials
  .trackingId(trackingId) // provide a Tracking ID for the asset to be tracked
  .routingProfile(.cycling) // provide a routing profile for better location enhancements
  .log(LogConfiguration()) // provide logging configuration
  .delegate(self) // provide a delegate to handle received location updates
  .start() // start listening to updates
```

## Example Apps

This repository also contains example apps that showcase how Ably Asset Tracking SDKs can be used:

- the [Asset Publishing example app](PublisherExample/)
- the [Asset Subscribing example app](SubscriberExample/)

To build the apps you will need to specify credentials properties. Create a file called `Secrets.xconfig` in the root project directory (You can copy `Example.Secrets.xcconfig`, e.g. using `cp Example.Secrets.xcconfig Secrets.xcconfig`) and update the following values in the file:

- `ABLY_API_KEY`: Used by publishing and subscribing example apps to authenticate with Ably using basic authentication. Not recommended in production.
- `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Used to access Mapbox Navigation SDK/ APIs.

## Development

### Project structure

The project follows standard Pods with subprojects architecture , so you'll find `AblyAssetTracking.xcworkspace` file which, after opening in Xcode reveals `Core`, `Publisher`, `Subscriber`, `PublisherExample`, `SubscriberExample` and `Pods` projects.

- `Core` (and tests)
  <br> Contains all shared logic and models (i.e. GeoJSON mappers) used by Publisher and Subscriber. Notice that there is no direct dependency between Publisher/Subscriber and Core. Instead of that, all files from Core should be also included in Publisher/Subscriber targets (by a tick in the Target Membership in Xcode's File Inspector tab). It's designed like that to avoid creating Umbrella Frameworks (as recommended in `Don't Create Umbrella Frameworks` in [Framework Creation Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/CreationGuidelines.html)) - there are some shared sources which we want to be publicly visible for client apps and it won't work with direct dependencies.
- `Publisher` (and tests)
  <br> Contains all sources needed to get the user's location and send it to Ably network.
- `Subscriber` (and tests)
  <br> Contains all sources needed to listen Ably's network for updated asset locations
- `PublisherExample` (without tests)
  <br> Example app demonstrating Publisher SDK usage
- `SubscriberExample` (without tests)
  <br> Example app demonstrating Subscriber SDK usage and presenting asset locations on the map
- `Pods`
  <br> The additional Xcode project generated for Cocoapods

### Build instructions

Project use CocoaPods, Fastlane, and Bundler (to make sure that the same version of development tools is used) and is developed using Xcode 12.2. However, building it's not straightforward and requires some extra steps.

1. Setup `.netrc` file as described in MapBox SDK documentation [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/search/guides/install/#configure-credentials). You can skip public token configuration for now. This is needed to obtain the Mapbox SDK dependency.
2. Install bundler using:

```
gem install bundler
```

3. Navigate to the project directory (one with .xcodeproj file) and execute:

```
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

4. Open `AblyAssetTracking.xcworkspace` file. After updating `Info.plist` with the MapBox public key, you should be ready to run the example apps.

#### Why Bundler

It's common that several developers (or CI) will have different tool versions installed locally on their machines, and it may cause compatibility problems (some tools might work only on dedicated versions). So to avoid asking everyone to upgrade/downgrade their local tools it's easier to use some tool to execute needed commands with preset versions and that's what Bundler does. Of course, you are still free to execute all CLI commands directly if you wish.

Here is the list of tools versioned with the Bundler with their versions:

- `CocoaPods` (1.10.0)
- `Fastlane` (2.169.0)
- `Slather` (2.6.0)

You may always check `Gemfile.lock` as it's the source of truth for versions of used libraries.

### Running tests

There are two ways of running tests in the project. The first one is standard for all Xcode projects and requires only selecting the correct active scheme in Xcode (`Core`/`Subscriber`/`Publisher`) and running tests from the `Product` -> `Test` menu.

Another one involves `Fastlane` and is executed from the command line:

```zsh
# run tests for the Core target
bundle exec fastlane test_core

# run tests for the Publisher target
bundle exec fastlane test_publisher

# run tests for the Subscriber target
bundle exec fastlane test_subscriber

# run tests for all targets
bundle exec fastlane test_all
```

Additionally, when you run tests using `Fastlane` you will see three new directories created: `coverage_core`, `coverage_publisher`, `coverage_subscriber`. Each contains an `index.html` file with a full test coverage report for the given target.

### Coding Conventions and Style Guide

- The SDKs are written in Swift, however they still have to be compatible for use from Objective-C based apps.
- Favor Protocol Oriented Programming with Dependency Injection when writing any code. We're unable to create automatic mocks in Swift, so it'll be helpful for writing unit tests.
- SwiftLint is integrated into the project. Make sure that your code does not add any SwiftLint related warning.
- Please remove default Xcode header comments (with author, license and creation date) as they're not necessary.
- If you're adding or modifying any part of the public interface of SDK, please also update [QuickHelp](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/SymbolDocumentation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH51-SW1) documentation.

### Concepts and assumptions

- SDK’s should be distributed using CocoaPods (at the beginning), later we’ll add support for Carthage and Swift Package Manager
- At the beginning, we aim only to support iOS, but we need to keep in mind macOS and tvOS
- Docs are written for both Swift and ObjC

### Working on code shared between Publisher and Subscriber

To speed up CocoaPods setup we removed framework/project linking in Xcode and we're just referencing files from the `Core` framework in `Publisher` and `Subscriber` SDK. There is a [ticket](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa/issues/43) to fix it in the future, but for now, if you need to add or move any file in the `Core` SDK make sure that you also reference them in `Publisher` and `Subscriber`.

### Release Procedure

#### Bumping the Version

To increment the version information for each release from the `main` branch:

1. Search for all instances of the `CFBundleShortVersionString` key in `Info.plist` files and increment according to release requirements, conforming to the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) version 2.0.0.
2. Search for all instances of the `CFBundleVersion` key in `Info.plist` files and increment the integer value by 1, ignoring those indirected via `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` (see next step).
3. Search for all instances of the `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` key in `project.pbxproj` filesand increment the integer value by 1.

The version, both in SemVer string form and as an integer, **MUST** be the same across all projects in this repository (e.g. example app project versions must match those of the library they're built on top of).
